# go-virtualbox

This is a wrapper package for Golang to interact with VirtualBox. The API is
experimental at the moment and you should expect frequent changes.

API doc at http://godoc.org/github.com/riobard/go-virtualbox

## Testing 

You need to  have a pre-provisioned VirtualBox VM and  to set its name
using the `TEST_VM` environment variable.
